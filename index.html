<p class="testimonial-text">
            “My name is Cherry Hlaing, a 20-year-old from Myanmar. I come from a
            family of seven and am the eldest of five siblings. By God's grace,
            my parents are doing well. I belong to the Khumi tribe and attend
            KCC Church. Growing up in a Christian family, I received true
            salvation through Jesus Christ in 2023–2024, though I have not yet
            been baptized. After being born again, I committed my life to
            serving God. That’s why I came to study His Word and began my B.Th.
            first year at Glory Education Centre (GEC).”

<p class="testimonial-text">
            “My name is Chingsiamlian, and I’m 18 years old from Tio, Chin
            State, Myanmar. My father is Dalsuanmung, and my mother is
            Lalruatmawii. I have six sisters and one brother. I belong to the
            Tio tribe, and my denomination is Bethel Baptist Church (BBC). I am
            currently studying at Glory Education Centre (GEC). I received
            salvation in May 2021 when I was still very young. During that time,
            I reminded myself that God always knows what is good and best for
            me. I have found my spiritual home in my village church.”

            “My name is John Naing Thang. I have two brothers and two sisters
            and was raised in a Christian family. From a young age, my parents
            taught me to read and meditate on the Bible. The book of Proverbs
            became my favorite, teaching me how to be a good son and a kind
            person. At the age of 14, I came to truly understand what Jesus had
            done for me and accepted Him as my Lord and Savior by His grace.
            Now, I’m here at Glory Education Centre to study God’s Word and grow
            deeper in my faith. I’m excited for what God has in store for me.”
